# Modules you wish to install as part of your setup.

# Note - if you wish to build all of these, it needs to be done locally as the total build time for hub.docker.com seems to be capped at 240 minutes, and
# building all of these modules will take longer than that. I updated the default enabled modules to include the ones interesting to me, but if these 
# do not fit your needs, build this locally or drop me a line and I will look at enabling it
